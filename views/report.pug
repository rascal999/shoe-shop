                h1 Report
                p This lab emphasises the importance of deprecating old API endpoints, removing test/debug code, and ensuring that developers are aware of and follow relevant standards (in this case, the PCI-DSS).
                h2 Summary
                p This web application contains a number of security vulnerabilities and standards violations, including:
                ul
                  li A deprecated and vulnerable endpoint is accessible #[a(href='/api/v1/cards') /api/v1/cards]
                  ul
                    li Returns full unmasked PAN
                    ul
                      li Unmasked PAN should not be returned to customers in accordance with #[a(href='https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/regional/na/us/partner-with-us/documents/8-digit-bin-pci-security-requirements-visa-position-paper.pdf') PCI DSS Requirement 3.3]
                    li Returns CVV
                    ul
                      li CVV shouldn't be stored in accordance with PCI DSS requirements after authorisation
                  li PAN not encrypted
                  ul
                    li While not demonstrable via the web app itself, a cursory glance over the source code will highlight the fact that PANs are not encrypted, which is in violation of #[a(href='https://kirkpatrickprice.com/video/pci-requirement-3-4-render-pan-unreadable-anywhere-stored/') PCI DSS Requirement 3.4]
                  li JWT signature can be invalid / algorithm can be set to 'none'
                  ul
                    li It's possible to modify the JWT such that a signature is not required. This allows attackers to impersonate other users and retrieve sensitive information, such as card payment information
                  li JWT contains user ID
                  ul
                    li An identifier in the JWT can be used to estimate the number of users of the application, which could be considered commercially sensitive. Chained with the JWT signature issue highlighted above, an attacker can leverage this issue to enumerate and ultimately impersonate other users

                h5 1. A deprecated and vulnerable endpoint is accessible #[a(href='/api/v1/cards') /api/v1/cards]
                p XXX
                h5 2. PAN not encrypted
                p XXX
                h5 3. JWT signature can be invalid / algorithm can be set to 'none'
                p XXX
                h5 4. JWT contains user ID

                h2 Notes
                p This is the first Express application I have written, so I suspect the code could be improved upon.
